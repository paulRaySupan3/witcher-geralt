      <h2>About Geralt of Rivia</h2>
      <hr>
      &#10077; &#10078;
      <p>
        Geralt of Rivia is the main protagonist of the <a href="https://thewitcher.com/en/witcher3/" target="_blank" title="The Witcher by CD Projeckt Red">Witcher franchise</a>. He is a witcher, a magically-enhanced mutant who slays monsters for a price, and the adopted father of <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Ciri" target="_blank" title="Who is Ciri?">Ciri</a>. Despite the fact that witchers have a reputation for being heartless and the mutations are meant to kill emotions, Geralt still has a conscience and generally helps others because it's the right thing rather than to get paid, though he rarely goes out of his way to admit this.
      </p>
      <p>
          Despite his name, Geralt does not come from Rivia: he grew up in the witchers' keep of <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/School_of_the_Wolf" target="_blank" title="Kaer Morhen">Kaer Morhen</a> in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all that remained of his chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative, and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic.

      <p>
          Geralt has a soft spot for the common man, though. Content he is to watch some Earl be killed over petty land disputes, but he has a real big problem when it comes to letting the little guy get kicked around. This is usually the source of all his political discomfort, but it's earned him many great and loyal friends like the bard Dandelion or sorceress/sometimes lover Triss Merigold. These are friends who stuck by him even after his apparent death at the hands of an angry mob after attempting to defend a group of non-humans from a hate-fueled slaughter.

        <h2>Biography</h2><hr>
      </p>
    <p>
      Geralt was the son of sorceress Visenna and (presumably) a warrior called Korin. Shortly after being born, Geralt was taken by his mother to the <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/School_of_the_Wolf" target="_blank" title="School of the Wolf">Wolf School - Kaer Morhen</a> stronghold (from Elder Speech Caer a'Muirehen meaning "Fortress of the Old Sea"). Geralt survived numerous mutations during the <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Trial_of_the_Grasses" target="_blank" title="Trial of the Grasses">Trial of the Grasses</a>, through which he gained practically superhuman physical and mental abilities (increased reflexes, speed, strength and enhanced hearing) surprisingly well.<br>
      <br>
      Because of that, as one of the few he was selected for additional experiments, and of the few he was the only one that survived. His white hair, completely lacking pigment, is a side effect of these experiments. After finishing the witcher training, he embarked into the world on his horse called "Roach" (he gave the same name to every one of his horses) to become a monster slayer for hire.<br>
      <br>
      Although Geralt did not believe in destiny, he demanded the unborn child of princess Pavetta and her husband Duny as a reward for his services. As the child turned out to be a girl, he did not take her. However, fate or blind chance caused Geralt and Ciri, the daughter of Duny and Pavetta to cross paths thrice, and after the death of her grandmother, queen Calanthe, Geralt ended up taking care of the girl and loving her as his own daughter. His best friend was Dandelion the bard, while his lover and the love of his life was <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Yennefer" target="_blank" title="Who is Yennefer?">Yennefer</a>.
